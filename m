Yes, that's true. The tree as visible in /sys/firmware is the modified 
version, because the modifications are performed on the DTB before it is 
unflattened and copied. This is what can be seen with the update:

# ls /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/soc\@0/mmc\@1180000002000/mmc-slot\@0/
bus-width  compatible  max-frequency  name  reg  voltage-ranges

OK, well we can go back to that...

Best to keep the support in the driver, I think.

OK cool, well let's go back to that version, then.

Thanks,
