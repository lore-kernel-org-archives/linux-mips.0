Thanks - for the record I did test on a Ci20, though I was booting using
my ci20-usb-boot tool which doesn't currently provide a command line to
the kernel. CONFIG_CMDLINE didn't get duplicated though.

I'll get back to a v2 for this & hopefully get it fixed up for 4.19, but
it might take a little while because my son was just born on Saturday :)

Thanks,
    Paul
