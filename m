Cristoph,
Could you please respond to my comments?  Even a negative response is
better than none.  The problem with doing what you suggested is with
ARM -- ARM64 and MIPS relatively uncomplicated .  With ARM, I have to
define the aforementioned functions -- the only way of doing this is
to define arch/arm/mach-bcm/include/mach/memory.h, and for that to be
picked up we no longer can have CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM=y, which is
an unacceptable cost to pay for just an unusual PCIe RC controller.

Regarding my current submission -- you are right, SWIOTLB will not
work for EPs that require it.  However, we don't care about these
devices, and can just bailout with EPs when the dma_mask is <=
0xffff_ffff or if swiotlb_force ==  SWIOTLB_FORCE.  Note that this
would only affect PCIe DMA.  We also have no plan of using MIPS64.
