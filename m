On OCTEON, SC implies a SYNC operation for the target memory location. 
So the "SC b" is ordered before any writes that come after the SC.

It makes my head hurt.

The sequence:

    SYNCW
    LL a
    <other instructions that are not stores>
    SC a


Should function as a "<general barrier>".


I can try to explain why I think this is so:

Coherency is managed by the L2 Cache controller.

Each CPU has an n-entry write buffer.  The SYNCW insures that all 
preceding stores will commit before the store of the SC.  the 
instruction after the SC will not execute until the SC's store is committed.

The full SYNC instruction functions in a similar manner to the above 
sequence.  The only difference is that it doesn't have the side effect 
of modifying the target of the SC instruction.

In both cases all the stores are committed, and following loads are 
delayed until the commit is acknowledged.

Note:  All this is based on my understanding of the OCTEON 
micro-architecture.  I have not done any exhaustive testing Transitivity 
principle with respect to SYNCW/LL/SC as described above.
