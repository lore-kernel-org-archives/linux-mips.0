These export functions can be abused and called directly from the controller
driver bypassing the phy core.

Actually lot of generic PHY programming are done in the phy-core itself. (For
example, the generic PHY regulator binding "phy-supply" can be used for the phy
core to enable the regulator during power on and disable during power off, phy
core also invokes pm_runtime API's during power_on and power_off which can be
used to enable/disable clocks). So drivers which are less generic can just
populate their specific handling part in their phy ops and leave the rest to be
done in phy core.
"simple-phy" should be used to avoid adding new PHY drivers that does simple
PHY ops.

Thanks
Kishon
