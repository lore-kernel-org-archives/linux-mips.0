That's not really true. You can evaluate that information with
mmap_sem held for read as well. Nothing can change the mappings until
you drop it. So you could do:

   down_write(mm->bd_sem);
   down_read(mm->mmap_sem;
   evaluate_size_of_shm_to_unmap();
   clear_bounds_directory_entries();
   up_read(mm->mmap_sem);
   do_the_real_shm_unmap();
   up_write(mm->bd_sem);

That should still be covered by the above scheme.

See above.

That works as well. If it makes stuff simpler I'm all for it. But then
we should really replace down_write(mmap_sem) with a helper function
and add something to checkpatch.pl and to the coccinelle scripts to
catch new instances of open coded 'down_write(mmap_sem)'.
