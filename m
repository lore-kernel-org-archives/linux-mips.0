MAP_FAULTPOPULATE would be usable for other cases as well. E.g. fault
around is all or nothing feature. Either all mappings (which support
this) fault around or none. There is no way to tell the kernel that
this particular mapping shouldn't fault around. I haven't seen such a
request yet but we have seen requests to have a way to opt out from
a global policy in the past (e.g. per-process opt out from THP). So
I can imagine somebody will come with a request to opt out from any
speculative operations on the mapped area in the future.

I am not sure I understand your point here. Could you be more specific
how would you check for that and what for?
