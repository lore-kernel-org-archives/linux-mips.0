Or -EINTR. I do not really mind, I only mentioned this because I had another
nit.

That is why you should always use _killable (or _interruptible) if you
want to take ->cred_guard_mutex.

If this thread races with de_thread() which holds this mutex, it will
be killed and mutex_lock_killable() will fail.

(to clarify; this deadlock is not "fatal", de_thread() can be killed too,
 but this doesn't really matter).

Yes, I missed another signal_group_exit() in seccomp_set_mode_strict().
It looks equally unneeded.

I'd prefer to simply remove the singal_group_exit checks.

I won't argue if you prefer to keep them, but then please add a comment
to explain that this is not needed for correctness.

Because otherwise the code looks confusing, as if there is a subtle reason
why we must not do this if killed.

Oleg.
