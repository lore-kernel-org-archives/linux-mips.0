IMHO this decision should really be revisited now.  Originally hugetlb
was pretty simple, but these days it has most of the functionality of a
full VM now. In fact with THP we have 3 different VM systems now, all
subtle different with different issues. And with THP hugetlb will be
even more widely used than it is today.

On the other hand there are strange gaps now, like shared memory
doesn't work with THP, but only with hugetlbfs.

It would be far better to think about unifying these three VMs. Then with
less ifdefs it would also not need hacks like this anymore.
