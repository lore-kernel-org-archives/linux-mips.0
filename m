This looks nicer than the current shape, but this still requires to
register a PCI fixup to override phys_to_dma() and dma_to_phys(), and it
would appear that you have dodged my question about how this is supposed
to fit with an entirely modular PCIe root complex driver? Are you
suggesting that we split the module into a built-in part and a modular part?

OK.
