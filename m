Absolutely, I don't think we disagree there.

I could do that, but it would feel rather odd to describe the clock
hardware as a child of a bunch of miscellaneous registers that happen to
expose some information about those clocks. Is that really what you
prefer? I think as-is the DT is a better description of the hardware.
