I don't think backwards compatibility will matter - the bootloaders I've 
come across don't ship DTBs with them and I don't think there are any 
ralink devices using the upstream MT7620 DT.

John might have some thoughts on backwards compat though.

Shall I respin this patch with the earlier nodes (intc etc) renamed and 
then send a patch later to rename the serial ports in the DT and kernel 
(assuming there are no backwards compatibility issues)?

Thanks,

Harvey
