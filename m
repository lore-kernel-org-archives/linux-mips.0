That works. I didn't have a strong feeling about it. I was just
wondering if there was a good way to self-document that phase1 is on
the fast path, and phase2 was on the slow path for tracing. The
existing comments really should be sufficient, though.

You mentioned architectures providing "sd" directly. I wonder if that
new optional ability should be mentioned in the Kconfig help text that
defines what's needed for an arch to support SECCOMP_FILTER?
