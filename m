On MIPS we normally place the kernel in KSEG0 or XKPHYS which address
segments which are not mapped through the TLB so the difference is
kinda moot.

On MIPS a key concern was maintaining a reasonable size for the final
kernel image.  The R_MIPS_LO16 relocatio records make a significant
portion of the relocations in a relocatable .o file, so we wanted to
get rid of them.  This results in a relocation granularity of 64kB.
If we were truely, truely stingy we could come up with a relocation format
to save a few more bits but I doubt that'd make any sense.

It could but yet again, the idea was to keep the size of the final
generated file under control.  The R_MIPS_HIGHER and R_MIPS_HIGHEST
relocations can be discarded if we constrain the addresses to be in
a single 4GB segment.  Removing this constraint would make a kernel
image much bigger so I suggested to add this restriction at least for
this initial version.
