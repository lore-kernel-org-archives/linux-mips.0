We need a definitive set of patches to apply.  If Paul's patches are not 
sufficient, work with Jan to create and test a set (perhaps including 
reversions) that will make it work on both OCTEON and Thunder, noting 
any dependencies on Paul's patches.  Then get that posted ASAP so that 
I2C can work again
