Sure, for any removal of optimized code it's always possible to
hypothesize a case where it regresses performance.  The question is
whether it actually matters and is worth keeping around.  You mentioned
that you did care about this code, but no longer do.  I think anyone who
may have cared about this in the past is likely to have had a similar
experience.

After all, the only line of SoCs that could run this code switched from
MIPS to ARM in 2016.  Meanwhile, TCP-MD5 itself is insecure and has been
superseded by TCP-AO.  (Note that TCP-AO supports HMAC-SHA1 and
HMAC-SHA256, which are still accelerated on MIPS Cavium Octeon.)

Yes, there are still people using TCP-MD5 anyway (on some platforms, not
necessarily this particular one).  But a nudge towards upgrading to
TCP-AO isn't necessarily a bad thing, either...

It's just a mistake from a long time ago (2010) that still has to be
maintained for backwards compatibility.  It's not something that would
be accepted in the kernel if it was proposed today.
